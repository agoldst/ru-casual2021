Source for a blog post, [andrewgoldstone.com/blog/ru-casual2021](https://andrewgoldstone.com/blog/ru-casual2021). To render the R markdown file exactly as it is here, you also have to install my [custom R markdown template](https://github.com/agoldst/hugormd): `devtools::install_github("agoldst/hugormd")`. Then run `make` to download the necessary data files from [IPEDS](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/) and generate the output figures.
